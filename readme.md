# Welcome to my dump of elim data, which is updated whenever I get around to it

Please note - since this is done manually (to comply with torn scripting rules) it does make mistakes. I've observed around 1-2% of users get missed, mostly due to them skipping pages. Check their updated boolean value to see if they were updated in the last check.

I upload the json almost immediately after finishing retrieving the data. It takes me around 20 minutes to collect all data for all teams, so again some data is slightly skewed. Check the most recent update on the json file, if the user was updated in that commit then their data was retrieved sometime in the 30 minutes before that commit.

feel free to contact me in-game with any queries about this data. 

#### What does the updated boolean mean?
When I update all my data, if I fail to get a new value for someone their "updated" boolean is assigned as false. This can either mean my scraping bugged (occasionally happens), or more usually that they've left the competition. You can normally get a good gauge of how many nubs you've forced to leave by how many false's you have, Nova.

### What does the final boolean mean?
Pretty self-explanatory, a user gains this when their team has been eliminated. Their data will no longer be updated/collected.
